                                AH, I can still remember that warm, comforting, and inviting aroma of the freshly baked croissants,
                                I started working there at a young age, and the first time I saw the bakers in action seemed like a mess,
                                everyone was running in which all had different tasks, and I was lost, <span class="emoji">&#128540;</span>,
                                it took me a while to find my place and it wasn't easy, however in order to successed I developed the golden rule of THE THREE D's
                                <span class="concept">dedication</span>
                                <span class="concept">,devotion,</span>
                                and attention to 
                                <span class="concept">details,</span>
                                I still live by these rules till today, and before I left I was at the highest position possible,
                                waking out remembering that first day, I realized it wasn't a mess,
                                we where just like a beehive where everyone has a role to play.

                                I was scared, I mean how could I convince anyone to buy from me, I tried and failed many times, 
                                it became frustrating,the pressure was huge like the weight of the world on my shoulders,
                                the first couple of days I came home empty-handed, realizing something was wrong I stopped, and took a break,
                                asking myself why should anyone buy from me, if I just could find the answer, and I did, the retailers needed to 
                                hear about how much good profit they going to make, so in order to sell anything, I also must first sell myself as a confident sales-representative 
                                so I went for another round, and by the end of that day I made my first sale, 
                                since that day I ask myself what distinguishes me or the product I'm selling from everything 
                                else, I finally found the concept of <span class="concept">value</span>.

                                Don't just listen to people's words, try to feel them as they are not machines,
                                and their words is not a computer code, it's their stories, hopes, and dreams,
                                a remarkable feeling when you bring someone's dream to reality, that's how it felt whenever I built someone their
                                dream house, one of the most important things that I had to do correctly was time management,
                                you need to understand, in this field, the schedule is always tight, and a one-second mistake might cost you thousands,
                                and maybe even days to fix, so you need to make sure with that good <span class="concept">time-management</span> skill,
                                 you must have good <span class="concept">planning</span>,

                                Steve Jobs once said: "Everybody should learn to program a computer because it teaches you how to think."<br><br>
                                wise words I say, a great insight, it's not just a code it's a way of thinking, a way of living,
                                when I started learning to program I was excited but shortly after it turned into a nightmare, 
                                overwhelmed, with a million things that I couldn't do, however Programming taught me to never say "I can't do it", rather say 
                                <span class="concept">I can't do it yet</span>,
                                and I can't know if I will make it or not, till <span class="concept">I try with my best</span>, and the more time I spend out of my

                                the more strength, confident, and knowledge I gain, and the key was to have <span class="concept">a plan where quitting is no part of it</span>.
